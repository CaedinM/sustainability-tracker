# Sustainability Tracker - Frontend  

This is the frontend for the Sustainability Tracker project.  
The frontend is built using Angular and provides an interactive UI for adding and tracking sustainability actions.

---

## **How to Use**
### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/) (v15 or higher)  
  Install Angular CLI if you haven't already:
  `npm install -g @angular/cli`

### **Installation**
Clone this repository and install dependencies:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/CaedinM/sustainability-tracker.git
cd sustainability-tracker/backend`
npm install
```
### **Running the Frontend**
Start the Angular server using `ng serve --open`  
The frontend UI will open in your default browser at localhost:4200

## **Features**
- View sustainability actions in a table format.
- Add new sustainability actions using the input form.
- Interact with the backend API via GET and POST requests.

## **Troubleshooting**
- If backend API isn't connecting, ensure `node server.js` is running in `/backend/`
- If UI isn't updating after adding an action, check the Console Log for errors (`F12`).
